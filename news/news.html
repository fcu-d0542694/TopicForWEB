          <br><p>The owner and the manager of a South Korean building where 29 people died last week in a fire have been arrested, a local police official said Tuesday.</p></br>
          <p>The fire, which ripped through an eight-story building in the city of Jecheon in North Chungcheong province, was the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/21/asia/south-korea-building-fire/index.html" target="_blank">deadliest blaze in South Korea </a>in nine years.</p>
          <br><p>The owner of the building, whose surname is Lee, is accused of violating fire safety regulations and committing involuntary homicide by negligence, the official said. Meanwhile, the building's manager, whose surname is Kim, is accused of involuntary homicide. The men's complete names were not released, as is customary in South Korea.</p></br>
          <p>Police are seeking additional arrest warrants to extend the men's detention periods, the official said.</p>

          <p>Demolition worker Yuichi Aoki's face creases up when he thinks about Japan's future.</p>
          <p>"I got asked to resign from my job in the IT industry when I was 55," Aoki, 59, tells CNN as he takes a break from tearing down a derelict house in Saitama, Japan.</p><br>
          <p>"Now I have to work into my sixties. I worry about how my children and their children will cope with an increasingly ageing population."</p></br>
          <p>Considerably older than most of his co-workers, Aoki, a former IT worker is also one of only a handful of Japanese nationals employed by a Saitama-based demolition company owned by a Kurdish former asylum seeker.</p><br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170529093035-05-japan-immigration-super-169.jpg">
          <p>Yuichi Aoki (left) takes a break from demolishing a house in Saitama, Japan.</p><br>
          <p>The company, the majority of whose workers hail from Turkey, Iran and various parts of Africa, is somewhat unique in Japan, where foreign nationals make up just 1.6% of the country's overall population.</p></br>
          <p>Operated by Mehmet Yucel, 28, the company is part of a growing and largely unregulated grassroots economy, that is helping to ease Japan's labor shortage in so-called undesirable sectors such as demolition and construction.</p><br>
          <p>Since founding the company in 2016, Yucel says he has received daily calls from immigrants in search of work -- some with the right to work legally and others without.</p></br>
          <p>"Japan is turning a blind eye to these workers because it needs them, but it won't come up with a proper long-term strategy for them," says Yucel, whose company is located on the fringes of the Japanese capital.</p><br>
          <p>Yucel came to Japan 12 years ago to escape ethnic conflict. Now married to a Japanese woman, he has permanent residency status.</p></br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170530113244-08-japan-immigration-super-169.jpg">
          <p>Mehmet Yucel receives calls from both asylum seekers and Japanese people looking for work in Japan.</p><br>
          <p>Part of a increasing group of 2.23 million legal immigrants, Yucel considers himself one of the lucky ones. Though Japan is the fourth-largest donor to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), in 2016, it accepted just 28 refugees from a total of 10,901 applicants.</p></br>
          <h3> Graying population </h3>
          <p>Japan is considered a "super-aged" nation, where more than 20% of the population is over 65 and the birth rate has reached record lows.</p><br>
          <p>By 2060, the country's population is expected to plummet by more than 40 million from 2010, to 86.74 million people, according to a projection by the Japanese Health Ministry. With fewer workers paying taxes to support a growing silver population in need of pensions and healthcare services, Japan's economy is facing an unprecedented challenge.</p><br>
          <p>This year, labor shortages were the highest they'd been in 40 years, and analysts predict rising shortages in the years ahead.</p>

While stunningly beautiful in its own right, there are no trees, no plants that grow above shin level and no real grasslands to speak of.</p><p>But even though the country got its name around 985 AD when Eric the Red used a somewhat dishonest early marketing campaign to entice his fellow Vikings to settle this newly conquered land, there really is a green Greenland.</p><p>To find it involves a boat ride 90 kilometers into the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, due west from Greenland\'s third-largest town, the west coast port of Illulissat.</p><p>Siorarsuit beach can be found on Disko Island, a place that is exactly what those Viking settlers probably thought they were getting -- a land of kaleidoscopic beauty.</p><h3>Summer beach</h3><p>"I think this is the actual Greenland," says Rina Møller Lorentzen, a local sports star and musician from the island\'s biggest settlement, Qeqertarsuaq. "Every summertime is luxuriant here ... the land becomes green and full of life, with many colorful flowers."</p><p>The blooms here, says Lorentzen, outnumber those in the entire rest of the country, which is why the island hosts a botany center right on the beach\'s edge, attracting researchers from around the world.</p><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/RTwbBG"><p>Icebergs breaking a part is a summer spectacle.</p><p>The black Siorarsuit beach is completely unique to Disko, this is the only black sand beach in the whole country. Unique too are its red flat-top mountains -- known locally as the Grand Canyon.</p><p>"The nature, the scenery, everything about Disko, is very unique because unlike the rest of Greenland, Disko used to be volcanic, which is why the mountains exist," says Mark Mølgaard a local tour guide and hunter.</p><p>"We have many different landscapes here on this island. We have a black sand beach and basalt rocks and steep cliffs, high waterfalls and warm sources."</p></div>',
      '<div class="col-sm-6"><h1>The "Papa" of French nouvelle cuisine</h1><p>Carly Fisher • Published 16th December 2017</p><p>To the world, Daniel Boulud is a renowned culinary master with 14 restaurants worldwide, six James Beard Awards and the author of 9 books. But to his "French Connection" colleagues Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Eric Ripert and Jacques Torres, he is simply "papa." Growing up on a farm outside of Lyon, France, Boulud began honing his culinary chops at just 14 years old under the tutelage of world class French chefs. A prodigy in his own right, he was only 17 when he became a finalist for Best Culinary Apprentice in France.</p><p>Coming from two- and three-starred Michelin restaurants of France, Boulud felt a sense of responsibility to become an ambassador of French nouvelle cuisine. The first of his counterparts to arrive to the U.S. in the early \'80s, he became the Executive Chef at Le Cirque and earned his first James Beard Award in 1992. One year later, he cemented his career by opening, Daniel, a two-Michelin-starred restaurant that would become the flagship of his culinary empire.</p><p>For the full documentary, <a href="http://cnn.com/interactive/2017/12/travel/family-meal-nyc/">click here</a>. </p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><h1>7 of the best dishes in Paris and where to get them</h1><p>Culinary hipsters may disagree, but fine dining doesn\'t get much finer than in Paris. The capital of France was where legendary names in the world of cuisine such as Carême and Escoffier honed their craft.</p><p>Centuries on, their legacy remains in an astonishing array of creative talent cooking in stunning settings. Here are some of the standout dishes that will have you making travel plans in no time.</p><p>Next time you\'re in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/insider-guide-paris/index.html">Paris</a> or planning a trip, keep these seven great dishes in mind:</p><h3><strong>1, Gratinated onions à la Parisienne</strong>, Le Cinq</h3><p>Chef Christian Le Squer heads <a href="http://www.restaurant-lecinq.com/en/">Le Cinq</a> at the Four Seasons Hotel George V in the chic 8th arrondissement just off the Champs-Elysées. A native of Brittany, Le Squer\'s take on French haute cuisine brings with it a lightness of touch, something not often associated with the opulent palaces of three Michelin-starred French fine dining. </p><p>Entering through wrought-iron doors, the Le Cinq dining room is decorated in gold and gray with priceless furniture from the reign of French kings Louis XIV and XVI.</p><p>Le Squer\'s "gratinated onions à la Parisienne" is a French onion soup like no other. Think petite balls of onion, somehow filled with a warm onion broth -- just make sure you don\'t bite them with your mouth open. Black truffle, extracts of thyme and rosemary join croutons made with Parmesan to complete a brilliant deconstruction.</p><p>If you fancy a glass or two, the historic and legendary wine cellar under sommelier Eric Beaumard features an incredible 50,000 bottles with some dating back 300 years.</p><p><a href="http://www.restaurant-lecinq.com/en/">Restaurant Le Cinq</a>, 31 Avenue George V 75008 Paris; +33 (1) 4952 7154</p><h3><strong>2. Pike brioche</strong>, Alléno Paris au Pavillon Ledoyen</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/1sFPag"><p>Alléno Paris: What looks like a lemon brioche loaf is an incredible pike dish.</p><p>Few French restaurants can rival the history, location or clientele of <a href="http://www.pavillon-ledoyen.fr/">Alléno Paris au Pavillon Ledoyen</a>. Situated close to the French Prime Minister\'s residence of Le Matignon, it\'s where Napoleon Bonaparte first met Josephine, where artists and writers such as&nbsp;Degas, Monet and Zola would dine -- and even where duelists would reconcile, having failed to shoot each other in the Bois de Boulogne.</p><p>Superstar chef Yannick Alléno oversees the beautiful dining room and menu, one highlight of which is a surreal but brilliant take on brioche bread. It looks like bread, complete with golden-brown crust, but is made from... pike. The perfectly executed fish is almost like a mousse in texture, while a sauce made of celeriac is a sublime counterpoint.</p><p><a href="http://www.yannick-alleno.com/fr/restaurants-reservation/alleno/restaurant-3-etoiles-paris.html">Alleno Paris au Pavillon Ledoyen</a>, 8 Avenue Dutuit, 75008 Paris; +33 1 5305 1000</p><h3><strong>3. Rum Baba with Armagnac</strong>, Le Jules Verne</h3><p>The first of two venues under maestro Alain Ducasse, <a href="http://www.lejulesverne-paris.com">Le Jules Verne</a> boasts the best views in Paris thanks to its location on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower, 125 meters up. 2017 marks Ducasse\'s 10th year overseeing the venerable institution but guests have been dining in the tower since it opened back in 1889.</p><p>One standout of the six-course dinner menu at 230 euros ($250) per person is the seared sea scallop with cauliflower and gold caviar. But the classic dessert of rum baba with Armagnac and lightly whipped cream takes some beating. Unsurprisingly, the wine list is 100% French and the sommelier will happily guide you through pairings for the dinner menu.</p><p><a href="https://www.lejulesverne-paris.com/en">Le Jules Verne, Avenue Gustave Eiffel</a>, 75007 Paris; +33 (0) 1 4555 6144</p><h3><strong>4. Stuffed cabbage leaves</strong>, L\'Arpège</h3><p>Vegetable master Alain Passard opened L\'Arpège in 1986 and received his third Michelin star within a decade -- a remarkable achievement by French Michelin standards. Three wholly organic gardens around France provide produce that is harvested every morning and served in dishes at lunch or dinner that same day.</p><p>"The most beautiful cookery book was written by nature itself," says Passard, so diners can expect only the very best of more than 500 varieties of vegetables grown by his team to make it to his plates -- as well as the finest selection of fish and meat.</p><p><a href="http://www.alain-passard.com/en/">L\'Arpège</a>\'s Winter in the Garden menu at a cool 320 euros ($348) per person includes sublime stuffed cabbage leaves -- described more enticingly in French as "chou farci." </p><p><a href="http://www.alain-passard.com/en/">L\'Arpège</a>, 84 Rue de Varenne, 75007 Paris; +33 1 4705 0906</p><h3><strong>5. <strong></strong>Oyster violine</strong>, Pierre Gagnaire</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/tVQQQm"><p>Pierre Gagnaire: Oyster violine with broccoli purée and horseradish.</p><p><a href="http://www.pierre-gagnaire.com/">Pierre Gagnaire</a> has multiple Michelin stars to his name, including three at his eponymous dining room at the Hôtel Balzac in the heart of the city, steps from the Champs Élysées. He was also voted "best chef in the world" by his peers in 2015, so diners are in good hands.</p><p>Gagnaire\'s culinary philosophy is contemporary in approach but grounded in tradition. This materializes across beautiful dishes including an oyster violine with broccoli purée and horseradish. The artistic flair on the plates extends to the stylish interiors by English designer and artist Carolyn Quartermaine. Walls, for instance, are covered in torn pages of books.</p><p><a href="http://www.pierre-gagnaire.com/">Pierre Gagnaire</a>, 6, rue Balzac, 75008 Paris; +33 (0)1 5836 1250</p><h3><strong>6. Pigeon with wild strawberries</strong>, Hélène Darroze La Salle à Manger</h3><p>In the heart of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in the Left Bank\'s sixth arrondissement, Hélène Darroze continues to win public and critical acclaim for her work. Behind a modest façade sit three venues to choose from, the grandest of which is the simply named <a href="http://www.helenedarroze.com/fr/destination-paris.html#paris-salle-manger">La Salle à Manger </a>-- The Dining Room -- where her two-Michelin-star cuisine shines.</p><p>In the elegant and contemporary space Darroze, the inspiration for Colette in the movie "Ratatouille," gives diners a choice of dishes that includes Northern Ireland lobster with tandoori spices, carrot and coriander.</p><p>Elsewhere, pigeon from France\'s southwest Périgord region comes with an unusual and decadent combination of foie gras, beetroot, wild strawberries and Mexican mole sauce. Darroze remains unafraid to innovate and take diners on global flights of fancy with unexpected combinations of flavors and produce.</p><p><a href="http://www.helenedarroze.com/fr/destination-paris.html#paris-salle-manger">Hélène Darroze La Salle à Manger</a>, 4 Rue D\'Assas 75006 Paris; +33 1 4222 0011</p><h3><strong>7. Lobster, girolles and tomatoes</strong>, Le Meurice Alain Ducasse</h3><p>Rue de Rivoli runs elegantly past the Louvre and Tuileries gardens up to Place de La Concorde but none of its honey-colored buildings house a dining room to rival <a href="http://www.alainducasse-meurice.com/en">Le Meurice Alain Ducasse</a>. </p><p>Ducasse\'s two-Michelin-star dining room is one of the most beautiful in Paris thanks to its mix of 18th-century gilt and high style along with modern touches including Tulip chairs by the late Finnish-American designer Eero Saarinen.</p><p>The restaurant showcases the expertise of exec chef Jocelyn Herland in dishes such as lobster, tomato and girolles mushrooms in the 130 euro lunch menu ($141).</p><p><a href="https://www.alainducasse-meurice.com/en">Restaurant Le Meurice Alain Ducasse</a>, Hôtel Le Meurice, 228, rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris; +33 1 4458 1055</p></div>',
