          <br><p>The owner and the manager of a South Korean building where 29 people died last week in a fire have been arrested, a local police official said Tuesday.</p></br>
          <p>The fire, which ripped through an eight-story building in the city of Jecheon in North Chungcheong province, was the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/21/asia/south-korea-building-fire/index.html" target="_blank">deadliest blaze in South Korea </a>in nine years.</p>
          <br><p>The owner of the building, whose surname is Lee, is accused of violating fire safety regulations and committing involuntary homicide by negligence, the official said. Meanwhile, the building's manager, whose surname is Kim, is accused of involuntary homicide. The men's complete names were not released, as is customary in South Korea.</p></br>
          <p>Police are seeking additional arrest warrants to extend the men's detention periods, the official said.</p>

          <p>Demolition worker Yuichi Aoki's face creases up when he thinks about Japan's future.</p>
          <p>"I got asked to resign from my job in the IT industry when I was 55," Aoki, 59, tells CNN as he takes a break from tearing down a derelict house in Saitama, Japan.</p><br>
          <p>"Now I have to work into my sixties. I worry about how my children and their children will cope with an increasingly ageing population."</p></br>
          <p>Considerably older than most of his co-workers, Aoki, a former IT worker is also one of only a handful of Japanese nationals employed by a Saitama-based demolition company owned by a Kurdish former asylum seeker.</p><br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170529093035-05-japan-immigration-super-169.jpg">
          <p>Yuichi Aoki (left) takes a break from demolishing a house in Saitama, Japan.</p><br>
          <p>The company, the majority of whose workers hail from Turkey, Iran and various parts of Africa, is somewhat unique in Japan, where foreign nationals make up just 1.6% of the country's overall population.</p></br>
          <p>Operated by Mehmet Yucel, 28, the company is part of a growing and largely unregulated grassroots economy, that is helping to ease Japan's labor shortage in so-called undesirable sectors such as demolition and construction.</p><br>
          <p>Since founding the company in 2016, Yucel says he has received daily calls from immigrants in search of work -- some with the right to work legally and others without.</p></br>
          <p>"Japan is turning a blind eye to these workers because it needs them, but it won't come up with a proper long-term strategy for them," says Yucel, whose company is located on the fringes of the Japanese capital.</p><br>
          <p>Yucel came to Japan 12 years ago to escape ethnic conflict. Now married to a Japanese woman, he has permanent residency status.</p></br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170530113244-08-japan-immigration-super-169.jpg">
          <p>Mehmet Yucel receives calls from both asylum seekers and Japanese people looking for work in Japan.</p><br>
          <p>Part of a increasing group of 2.23 million legal immigrants, Yucel considers himself one of the lucky ones. Though Japan is the fourth-largest donor to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), in 2016, it accepted just 28 refugees from a total of 10,901 applicants.</p></br>
          <h3> Graying population </h3>
          <p>Japan is considered a "super-aged" nation, where more than 20% of the population is over 65 and the birth rate has reached record lows.</p><br>
          <p>By 2060, the country's population is expected to plummet by more than 40 million from 2010, to 86.74 million people, according to a projection by the Japanese Health Ministry. With fewer workers paying taxes to support a growing silver population in need of pensions and healthcare services, Japan's economy is facing an unprecedented challenge.</p><br>
          <p>This year, labor shortages were the highest they'd been in 40 years, and analysts predict rising shortages in the years ahead.</p>

While stunningly beautiful in its own right, there are no trees, no plants that grow above shin level and no real grasslands to speak of.</p><p>But even though the country got its name around 985 AD when Eric the Red used a somewhat dishonest early marketing campaign to entice his fellow Vikings to settle this newly conquered land, there really is a green Greenland.</p><p>To find it involves a boat ride 90 kilometers into the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, due west from Greenland\'s third-largest town, the west coast port of Illulissat.</p><p>Siorarsuit beach can be found on Disko Island, a place that is exactly what those Viking settlers probably thought they were getting -- a land of kaleidoscopic beauty.</p><h3>Summer beach</h3><p>"I think this is the actual Greenland," says Rina Møller Lorentzen, a local sports star and musician from the island\'s biggest settlement, Qeqertarsuaq. "Every summertime is luxuriant here ... the land becomes green and full of life, with many colorful flowers."</p><p>The blooms here, says Lorentzen, outnumber those in the entire rest of the country, which is why the island hosts a botany center right on the beach\'s edge, attracting researchers from around the world.</p><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/RTwbBG"><p>Icebergs breaking a part is a summer spectacle.</p><p>The black Siorarsuit beach is completely unique to Disko, this is the only black sand beach in the whole country. Unique too are its red flat-top mountains -- known locally as the Grand Canyon.</p><p>"The nature, the scenery, everything about Disko, is very unique because unlike the rest of Greenland, Disko used to be volcanic, which is why the mountains exist," says Mark Mølgaard a local tour guide and hunter.</p><p>"We have many different landscapes here on this island. We have a black sand beach and basalt rocks and steep cliffs, high waterfalls and warm sources."</p></div>',
      '<div class="col-sm-6"><h1>The "Papa" of French nouvelle cuisine</h1><p>Carly Fisher • Published 16th December 2017</p><p>To the world, Daniel Boulud is a renowned culinary master with 14 restaurants worldwide, six James Beard Awards and the author of 9 books. But to his "French Connection" colleagues Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Eric Ripert and Jacques Torres, he is simply "papa." Growing up on a farm outside of Lyon, France, Boulud began honing his culinary chops at just 14 years old under the tutelage of world class French chefs. A prodigy in his own right, he was only 17 when he became a finalist for Best Culinary Apprentice in France.</p><p>Coming from two- and three-starred Michelin restaurants of France, Boulud felt a sense of responsibility to become an ambassador of French nouvelle cuisine. The first of his counterparts to arrive to the U.S. in the early \'80s, he became the Executive Chef at Le Cirque and earned his first James Beard Award in 1992. One year later, he cemented his career by opening, Daniel, a two-Michelin-starred restaurant that would become the flagship of his culinary empire.</p><p>For the full documentary, <a href="http://cnn.com/interactive/2017/12/travel/family-meal-nyc/">click here</a>. </p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><h1>7 of the best dishes in Paris and where to get them</h1><p>Culinary hipsters may disagree, but fine dining doesn\'t get much finer than in Paris. The capital of France was where legendary names in the world of cuisine such as Carême and Escoffier honed their craft.</p><p>Centuries on, their legacy remains in an astonishing array of creative talent cooking in stunning settings. Here are some of the standout dishes that will have you making travel plans in no time.</p><p>Next time you\'re in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/insider-guide-paris/index.html">Paris</a> or planning a trip, keep these seven great dishes in mind:</p><h3><strong>1, Gratinated onions à la Parisienne</strong>, Le Cinq</h3><p>Chef Christian Le Squer heads <a href="http://www.restaurant-lecinq.com/en/">Le Cinq</a> at the Four Seasons Hotel George V in the chic 8th arrondissement just off the Champs-Elysées. A native of Brittany, Le Squer\'s take on French haute cuisine brings with it a lightness of touch, something not often associated with the opulent palaces of three Michelin-starred French fine dining. </p><p>Entering through wrought-iron doors, the Le Cinq dining room is decorated in gold and gray with priceless furniture from the reign of French kings Louis XIV and XVI.</p><p>Le Squer\'s "gratinated onions à la Parisienne" is a French onion soup like no other. Think petite balls of onion, somehow filled with a warm onion broth -- just make sure you don\'t bite them with your mouth open. Black truffle, extracts of thyme and rosemary join croutons made with Parmesan to complete a brilliant deconstruction.</p><p>If you fancy a glass or two, the historic and legendary wine cellar under sommelier Eric Beaumard features an incredible 50,000 bottles with some dating back 300 years.</p><p><a href="http://www.restaurant-lecinq.com/en/">Restaurant Le Cinq</a>, 31 Avenue George V 75008 Paris; +33 (1) 4952 7154</p><h3><strong>2. Pike brioche</strong>, Alléno Paris au Pavillon Ledoyen</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/1sFPag"><p>Alléno Paris: What looks like a lemon brioche loaf is an incredible pike dish.</p><p>Few French restaurants can rival the history, location or clientele of <a href="http://www.pavillon-ledoyen.fr/">Alléno Paris au Pavillon Ledoyen</a>. Situated close to the French Prime Minister\'s residence of Le Matignon, it\'s where Napoleon Bonaparte first met Josephine, where artists and writers such as&nbsp;Degas, Monet and Zola would dine -- and even where duelists would reconcile, having failed to shoot each other in the Bois de Boulogne.</p><p>Superstar chef Yannick Alléno oversees the beautiful dining room and menu, one highlight of which is a surreal but brilliant take on brioche bread. It looks like bread, complete with golden-brown crust, but is made from... pike. The perfectly executed fish is almost like a mousse in texture, while a sauce made of celeriac is a sublime counterpoint.</p><p><a href="http://www.yannick-alleno.com/fr/restaurants-reservation/alleno/restaurant-3-etoiles-paris.html">Alleno Paris au Pavillon Ledoyen</a>, 8 Avenue Dutuit, 75008 Paris; +33 1 5305 1000</p><h3><strong>3. Rum Baba with Armagnac</strong>, Le Jules Verne</h3><p>The first of two venues under maestro Alain Ducasse, <a href="http://www.lejulesverne-paris.com">Le Jules Verne</a> boasts the best views in Paris thanks to its location on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower, 125 meters up. 2017 marks Ducasse\'s 10th year overseeing the venerable institution but guests have been dining in the tower since it opened back in 1889.</p><p>One standout of the six-course dinner menu at 230 euros ($250) per person is the seared sea scallop with cauliflower and gold caviar.

That\'s what was done in Hong Kong and Osaka to expand airport capacity.</p><p>Some visionaries have taken a rather different approach.</p><p>What if we could make a runway float over the virtually limitless flat surface of the sea?</p><p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/27/travel/floating-piers-lake-iseo-italy/index.html">MORE: Italian pop-up artwork lets visitors walk on water</a></p><h3>Floating deck</h3><p>Aircraft carriers have floating runways, but they\'re also warships which need to be maneuverable and to travel at speed.</p><p>Their decks are too small to deal with commercial craft -- even the largest carrier falls short of the requirements of modern jet airliners.</p><p>But let\'s take the concept of the floating deck further.</p><p>What if we strip it of its engines and lower decks, anchor it in a set location, and then make it long enough and wide enough for a medium-sized airliner to land on it?</p><p>The result is a very large floating structure that\'s neither a ship nor an island: It\'s a floating airport.</p><h3>Forerunners from history</h3><p>During World War II, the British entertained the idea of building runways on icebergs in order to provide cover for the vital Atlantic convoys.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Habakkuk">Project Habakkuk</a> never materialized, but the floating airport concept lived on.</p><p>In 1995, 17 Japanese private firms, mostly shipbuilders and steelmakers, formed the Technological Research Association of Mega-Float with the support of the Japanese government.</p><p>The goal was to design and test a floating airport concept that, if successful, could be installed in Tokyo Bay -- and the <a href="http://db.flexibilni-architektura.cz/o/32">Tokyo Mega-Float</a> is possibly the most ambitious attempt of its kind to date. </p><p>The project called for a floating structure with a 4,000-meter-long runway, enough even for large airliners.</p><p>A smaller-scale model with a 1,000-meter-long runway was actually built and tests proved that the Mega Float was suitable for aircraft operations.</p><p>However, the project did not go ahead and the structure was later dismantled.</p><p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/20-iconic-planes-for-aviation-fans/index.html">MORE: 20 planes every aviation fan should experience</a></p><h3>San Diego proposal</h3><p>Similar proposals have been floated, quite literally in this case, for San Diego, a city whose international airport has little room left to expand in its current location.</p><p>Proposals to build a brand new two-runway international airport in the sea, a few miles off Point Loma have been put forward by two different companies, <a href="http://la.curbed.com/2009/10/23/10529664/take-the-underwater-train-out-to-the-floating-airport">OceanWorks Development</a> and <a href="http://floatinc.com/FloatingAirport.aspx">Float Inc</a>. </p><p>Whether it was the $20 billion price tag that proved a bit too expensive, or lingering doubts about the technical feasibility of the concept, the fact is neither project has materialized.</p><h3>Floating aerotropolis</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/b4AMTj"><p><br>The San Diego projects have some similarities with the floating airport concept devised by Terry Drinkard, an American aeronautical engineer who has conducted extensive research in this field.</p><p>His scheme draws heavily from technologies and materials that have already been tested in the construction of deepwater oil rigs.</p><p>Drinkard\'s vision is for a full-fledged <a href="http://www.blueskynews.aero/contributors/Floating_airport-A_pilot_project_TerryDrinkard.htm">offshore "aerotropolis:"</a> a floating structure that, as well as being able to handle medium-sized airliners (of the Boeing 737 or A320 types), would also host a whole range of economic and research activities, from experimentation with renewable energy technology to aquaculture and yachting.</p><p>This floating airport would be energy self-sufficient.</p><p>Power would be harvested from the waves, from the sun and through ocean thermal energy conversion, a technology that produces electricity by utilizing the temperature differences between depths of seawater.</p><p>Its structure would provide a base for oceanographic research and aquaculture and it would also double as a port and recreational marina, while its potential offshore status could attract a host of other economic activities.</p><p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/icelandair-stopover-buddies-klm-layover-local/index.html">MORE: The airlines making stopovers sweete</a></p><h3>Bridging the Atlantic</h3><p>A more daring version of the concept revives the idea, already put forward by a 1930 article in the magazine <a href="https://books.google.es/books?id=ueQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PP8&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Mps3Ts_RNKL_sQLdiN0q&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true">Popular Mechanics</a>, of bridging the Atlantic with a chain of such floating airports. </p><p>This would enable all sorts of aircraft, including smaller airliners and private jets, to cross the ocean without the need to secure costly ETOPS (extended-range twin-engine operational standards) certification or take the more indirect northern route through Iceland and Newfoundland.</p><p>But the most realistic chances for a floating airport might be found in warmer waters.</p><p>Commander Bud Slabbaert, aviation consultant and Drinkard\'s partner in this project, says a small-scale version of the floating airport is currently being evaluated by several governments and infrastructure operators in the Caribbean.</p><p>It\'s a region heavily dependent on air transport where the lack of space is compounded by some of the islands\' hilly or mountainous terrain.</p><p>Other aviation experts remain a lot more skeptical when consulted about the feasibility of the concept.</p><p>R. W. Mann, a consultant and former airline planning executive with several U.S. network airlines, thinks such an project is highly unlikely to get off the ground due to the relatively high cost and limited practical gain.</p><p>"Projects that involve building runways on the sea, such as those currently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/30/world/asia/what-china-has-been-building-in-the-south-china-sea-2016.html?_r=0">underway in the South China Sea</a>, are driven primarily by non-economic considerations," he says. </p><h3>Boris Island</h3><p>It\'s true that airports are a massive investment -- even more so if they have to be built over water.</p><p>So it\'s no surprise that, despite the concept of a floating airport having being around for a long time, it\'s failed to come to fruition yet.</p><p>Despite decades of increasing air traffic and sprawling urban development across the world, airport relocation is still a rarity -- Hong Kong did it in 1998 and Munich did it in 1992.</p><p>In London, the controversy about the future of Heathrow airport, one of the most congested major air hubs anywhere in the world, has been raging on for years.</p><p>Some of the most remarkable proposals to sort out London\'s air capacity problem involve relocation to the Thames Estuary, where the River Thames meets the North Sea.</p><p>Renowned architect Norman Foster came up with the concept of a four-runway airport to be built from scratch on the Isle of Grain, a marshy area some 30 miles east of central London.</p><p>The project was popularly known as "Boris Island", because former London mayor Boris Johnson was one of its most solid backers, but it was rejected by the UK Airports Commission in 2014.</p><p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/16/aviation/teruel-airport-spain/index.html">MORE: The huge ghost airport where planes to go sleep</a></p><h3>Six runways for $63 billion</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/AGhvEf"><p><br>A rather more <a href="http://testrad.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Thames-estuary-brochure.pdf">ambitious proposal</a> was put forward by the architecture firm Gensler and Thames Estuary Research and Development (Testrad), calling for the airport to be built right in the middle of the estuary.</p><p>In this vision, a six-runway airport would be built over the waters of the Thames Estuary at a cost of nearly $63 billion.</p><p>The runways would stretch parallel to each other on both sides of a central core, where the main terminal would be located.</p><p>The airport would be connected to land through underwater tunnels for high-speed rail connections.</p><p>Gensler considered two options, explains Ian Mulcahey, the firm\'s managing director.</p><p>The first was a floating structure along the lines of the Tokyo Mega-Float, but the water in that area proved too shallow.</p><p>So it opted for a "polder"-like concept, where dykes would be used to delimit the area of the airport and water would then be drained to create a dry, flat surface.</p><p>"Although it might sound challenging when compared to building on dry land, by building the airport in a body of water we can get away with the lengthy and costly process of gathering the huge expanse of land you need for a project of this size", says Mulcahey.</p><p>He insists the final decision about London airport expansion has not yet been taken.</p><p>On June 30, the UK\'s Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced that following the UK voting to leave the European Union, such decision-making has been delayed until "at least October."</p><p>So while an extra runway at Heathrow and Gatwick is by far the most popular solution <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36671328?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_linkname=news_central">being debated</a>, don\'t write off the Thames estuary gateway just yet. </p><h3>A question of economics</h3><p>What decades of studies about the feasibility of the floating airport concept has shown is that its ultimate development and application is not a matter of technology, but of getting the economics right.</p><p>The oil industry has demonstrated that when there is a pressing need -- and money to be made -- virtually any obstacle can be pushed aside.</p><p>The vast number of oil platforms defying the elements in some of the world\'s harshest environments are witness to it.</p><p>The same could one day be true of the floating airport.</p><p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/21/aviation/light-aircraft-land-sea-air/index.html">MORE: Sky pioneers: A light aircraft revolution is taking off</a></p></div><div

src="https://goo.gl/zGbWnX"><p><br> by concerns about climate change, governments and companies worldwide are making plans for a post-oil era.</p><p>But, while there have been efforts to limit carbon emissions in the aviation industry by using biofuels, no solution is in sight to replace kerosene-burning commercial aircraft.</p><p>And yet, as with the car industry, electrical propulsion looks to be the way forward for air <a href="http://www.cnn.com/travel">travel</a>. So why have things been going so slowly airside? Mainly, it seems, because innovators face a very large hurdle.</p><h3>Batteries vs jet fuel</h3><p>"Electric batteries pack much less energy per unit of weight than jet fuel," says Bjorn Fehrm, an independent industry aviation expert at Leeham News. About 40 times less, even if we consider the best batteries available.</p><p>"Electric motors partly compensate this disadvantage by being more efficient in converting energy into power, but a huge gap remains."</p><p>The result is that aircraft would need to carry very heavy batteries in order to even approach the performance of current airliners. This option, quite literally, wouldn\'t fly.</p><p>Difficult doesn\'t mean impossible, though.</p><p>Major industry players, research organizations and entrepreneurs are working on several possible paths to make commercial electric flying a reality within a few years. Here are some of the most promising initiatives in the field:</p><h3>Airbus: Disrupt or be disrupted</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/aYg7Ez"><p>In Europe, Toulouse-headquartered aircraft manufacturer Airbus has teamed up with German conglomerate Siemens to pursue its electrical aircraft research program.</p><p>Its <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/oshkosh-electric-planes/index.html">E-Fan</a> light aircraft managed to complete a crossing of the English Channel in 2015 by using only electric propulsion.</p><p>Since then, Airbus has ramped up its efforts and come up with some potentially disruptive concepts.</p><p>"We realized our earliest electrical aircraft projects were not ambitious enough," says Glenn Llewellyn, General Manager, Electrification at Airbus.</p><p>"We have since reoriented our development efforts and come up with some revolutionary concepts such as the Vahana and CityAirbus, that are close to becoming a tangible reality.</p><p>"They are going to have an impact in the way we understand urban mobility."</p><h3>Vahana</h3><p>A product of A³, Airbus\' Silicon Valley arm, Vahana is an unmanned electrical aircraft designed to move a passenger or small cargo within the confines of a city. </p><p>Its appearance is straight out of a science-fiction film. The passenger module nestles between two parallel wings, one above and one below, each holding four engines.</p><p>Its vertical take-off and landing capabilities make it possible to fly from building to building, which may turn into an alternative to land-based urban transportation. Vahana also incorporates technology that allows it to avoid obstacles and navigate the complexities of the urban environment.</p><p>In November 2017, the Vahana team announced that it\'s <a href="https://vahana.aero/our-journey-to-pendleton-ab6c79e9fb12" target="_blank">ready to begin flight testing</a>. </p><h3>CityAirbus</h3><p>Another futuristic concept that Airbus is working on is CityAirbus, whose maiden flight is scheduled for 2018.</p><p>Just like Vahana, it\'s self-piloted and will be able to take off and land vertically, making it ideally suited for urban use. The difference is that CityAirbus will be able to carry up to four passengers.</p><p>"In addition to zero emissions and low noise levels, we are confident their operating costs will make them competitive with traditional taxis," says Llewellyn.</p><p>In parallel to these projects, Airbus continues to work towards its longer-term aim of developing a fully electric airliner. The next major goal will be to develop an aircraft that crosses the megawatt threshold.</p><p>Airbus has plans underway for a 2MW (two-megawatt) aircraft. It\'s still a long way off what would be needed to power an alternative to present-day airliners, but already more than 60 times more powerful than the E-Fan\'s 30 kilowatts.</p><h3>Zunum Aero</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/6UsnmX"><p><br>US multinational Boeing has invested, together with Silicon Valley\'s JetBlue Technology Ventures, in Seattle-based startup Zunum Aero.</p><p>Zunum\'s hybrid-electric aircraft promises something akin to door-to-door air travel, flying quietly and economically to thousands of underused local airfields and bypassing more inefficent and often congested larger airports.</p><p>The initial concept will be able to carry 12 passengers up to 700 miles, but it\'s been designed with scalability in mind. The idea is to develop a family of aircraft of increasingly larger size and longer range.</p><p>Although it starts as a hybrid, its design allows for a smooth transition to full electrical propulsion when new battery technology becomes available.</p><h3>Eviation Aircraft</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/rVSj9H"><p><br>Eviation Aircraft also focuses on the short-range regional market.</p><p>This Israeli startup has come up with a sleek nine-passenger, self-piloted, all-electric aircraft to operate primarily in the 100 to 600 mile range (although the aircraft will have a longer maximum range).</p><p>"This is a market where the overwhelming majority of the journeys are now made by car, as it is not efficient to fly commercial," says Omer Bar-Yohay, founder and CEO of Eviation. "We are here to change this."</p><p>"Almost no one is riding 40-year-old cars and yet most aircraft in our size category derive from designs that are at least four decades old," continues Bar-Yohay, who, prior to starting Eviation Aircraft, worked in the electrical vehicle industry.</p><p>By using small local airports, Eviation Aircraft is looking at the same market as Zunum Aero.</p><p>"The opportunity is so big [...] that there is space for several operators, using different approaches," argues Bar-Yohay.</p><p>While Zunum "preferred to start with hybrid technology to get some extra range," Eviation Aircraft\'s optimistic belief is that "an all-electric aircraft is already able to serve our needs."</p><h3>NASA X-57 Maxwell</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/LppC9h"><p><br><a href="/travel/article/nasa-electric-plane/index.html">NASA\'s X-57 Maxwell</a> is an example of out-of-the-box thinking when it comes to electrical aircraft design. </p><p>This awkward-looking experimental plane uses the distributed propulsion provided by 14 electrical motors, all of them integrated into a specially designed high wing.</p><p>This unusual configuration, where the two larger motors at the wingtips reduce drag associated with wingtip vortices, is designed to bring about a 500% efficiency increase when cruising at higher speeds.</p><p>The X-57 is expected to fly in early 2018.</p><h3>Pipistrel Alpha Electro</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/MrQtLM"><p>It may lack the outlandish looks of other electric aircraft designs but, unlike them, the modest Slovenian-made two-seater Pipistrel Alpha Electro, whose first prototype was known as WATTsUP, has already reached production stage and is market-ready.</p><p>Powered by a 60-kilowatt electric engine developed by Siemens, the Alpha Electro can stay airborne for about an hour. Not a long time, admittedly, but more than enough for the training sorties it was designed for.</p><p>The Alpha Electro, which <a href="http://www.pipistrel-usa.com/price-list/RTF-price.html">costs $129,800</a>, and recharges its batteries the same way as a mobile phone, could significantly reduce the costs of initial pilot training, according to its manufacturer.</p><p>In addition to supplying some systems for NASA\'s X-57, Pipistrel is also working with Uber on the development of an electric vertical take-off (VTOL) vehicle for urban mobility.</p><h3>Wright Electric</h3><img class="img-fluid" src="https://goo.gl/9KsxEN"><p><br>In September 2017, US startup Wright Electric announced that it had partnered with European low-cost airline EasyJet in order to develop an all-electric airliner.</p><p>Wright Electric\'s truly ambitious project is to create an airliner in the 120-186 seat range capable of flying distances of up to 335 miles.</p><p>Although this isn\'t a particularly long range, it would be enough to cover many busy short-haul routes, such as London to Paris or New York to Boston.</p><p>The expectation is for range and capacity to be increased progressively as technology improves and that a whole family of aircraft will eventually be produced.</p><h3>Small is beautiful</h3><p>Independent experts in the field of electric propulsion remain cautious about the prospects for electric flight.</p><p>"I have crunched the numbers and I think we are still more than a decade away from having all-electric commercial airliners," says Bjorn Fehrm.</p><p>"The performance gap you need to bridge, particularly when it comes to the energy density of batteries, is huge."</p><p>However, he says smaller-scale projects like Vahana have a real chance of becoming the first commercially feasible electrical aircraft.</p><p>"You can scale gradually from there, but you have to start somewhere.</p><p>"The first aircraft may not be that competitive, but, as happened with cars, governments may use regulation to support electric aircraft, on the basis that they are quieter and less polluting."</p><h3>Gradual process</h3><p>Andreas Klöckner, coordinator for electric flight at DLR, the German Aerospace Center, agrees that the transition to electric flight is likely to be gradual.</p><p>"We already have electric aircraft for two to four passengers, like the Pipistrel Alpha Trainer or like the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hy4-fuel-cell-plane/index.html">HY4</a> flying fuel cell testbed. </p><p>Next you go for up to 19 passengers, like the Zunum concept. You learn and you keep scaling up until you reach commercial airliner classes."</p><p>For longer-range and heavier aircraft, however, he predicts that "as long as batteries are too heavy" hybrid solutions will be required.</p><p>Klöckner adds another element to the discussion.</p><p>"Research in the field of electric flight has some interesting derivatives. For example, electric motors could be distributed along the wing, such as with NASA\'s X-57," he says.</p><p>"In addition to aerodynamic advantages, this could make heavy vertical tails redundant."</p><p>Vertical tails are currently needed to steer during flight, but this is a task that could be taken on by electric motors as they react very quickly to commanded speed changes.</p><p>Says Klöckner, "It opens up new ways to think about aircraft design."</p><p>"Unlike jet engines, the efficiency of electric motors doesn\'t benefit from size, so instead of two or more large engines under the wings you can have many smaller motors distributed along the fuselage," explains Jeff Engler, CEO of Wright Electric.</p><p>This would lead not only to quieter, cleaner aircraft, but also ones that look radically different to those in the air today.</p></div>',
